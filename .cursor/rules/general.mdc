In this project we use bun, not npm, yarn or pnpm. We use bun for package management and running scripts. But node for production.

Always read the [LEARNINGS.md](mdc:LEARNINGS.md) before getting started.
Periodically go back and write in the [LEARNINGS.md](mdc:LEARNINGS.md) to add new learnings from building this project. This acts as a memory bank for you.

Don't EVER do inline comments.
